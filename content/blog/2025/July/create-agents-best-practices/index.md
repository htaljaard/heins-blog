### Introduction
Creating agents in Co-Pilot Studio can be an exciting endeavor! To ensure it goes smoothly and remains under control, it's important to follow best practices. In this blog post, we'll dive into why it's vital to steer clear of the default environment and how using Power Platform solutions can provide an effortless experience.

### Understanding the Default Environment
When creating agents in Co-Pilot Studio, the default environment in Power Platform automatically adds artifacts to the default solution. This can lead to governance issues over time, so it's crucial to use controlled environments for better management.

 

### Using Controlled Environments
Boost your governance by collaborating with your IT team to set up separate environments. These controlled spaces allow better oversight on who can create artifacts and enable deployment pipelines for isolated areas. This method ensures a smooth transition from development to production.

 

### Creating Solutions for Agents
Agents should be integrated into applications, packaged within solutions. Implementing environment variables for deployment means agents won't touch production resources during development. This enhances maintainability and control significantly.

 

### Conclusion
Steering clear of the default environment and utilizing Power Platform solutions for governance and control is essential for creating agents in Co-Pilot Studio. By adhering to these best practices, you'll secure a smooth and controlled experience. Watch the full video for detailed steps and insights.
