## **Fixing Prompt Input Issues in Copilot Studio with YAML**

If you've worked with Copilot Studio and tried reusing prompts across agents, you've likely run into a frustrating issue: your carefully designed inputsâ€”like role, experience, and technologyâ€”disappear when the prompt is reused.

### **The Problem**
When you add a custom prompt to an agent, the input fields often donâ€™t carry over. This breaks the functionality and forces you to recreate prompts manually for each agent.

### **The Fix**
The solution lies in editing the prompt in **code view** and defining the inputs using **YAML**. Hereâ€™s what you need to include for each input:

- `kind`: Usually set to `automatic task input`
- `name`: The display name (e.g., "Role")
- `property name`: The internal name used in the tool (e.g., `role`)
- `shouldPromptUser`: Set to `false` if you donâ€™t want the user to be prompted

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If your property name includes spaces, Copilot Studio encodes them as `_20` (e.g., `job_20role`). This is similar to how URLs handle spaces.

### **Why It Matters**
Defining inputs properly in YAML allows you to:
- Reuse prompts across multiple agents
- Maintain consistency in your tools
- Avoid redundant configuration work



### **Final Thoughts**
This small but powerful fix helps streamline your workflow in Copilot Studio. As the platform evolves, these kinds of manual tweaks may become obsoleteâ€”but for now, theyâ€™re essential for getting the most out of your custom tools.
