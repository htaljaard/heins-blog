### Introduction
Hey everyone! Today, I want to share some insights and experiences I've had with Co-pilot Studio tools, specifically focusing on prompts. Over the last 24 hours, I've encountered some significant issues that I believe many of you might also be facing. In this blog post, I'll walk you through these challenges and the solutions I've been working on. Let's dive in!

### Understanding Prompts in Co-pilot Studio
Prompts in Co-pilot Studio are essential for creating consistent and effective workflows. They allow us to connect to APIs, agent flows, and Power Platform connectors, making the tools immensely powerful. For instance, when creating a tool, we have options to create agent flows and custom connectors, which are crucial for maintaining consistency across environments.

### Challenges with Custom Prompts
One of the main challenges I've faced is with custom prompts. For example, when creating a job description agent, the custom prompt needs to have a preset instruction or intent. However, if you forget to change the date and time in the prompt, it can cause issues. Additionally, renaming objects and database tables can be problematic, as you can't rename the underlying object name, leading to inconsistencies.

Another significant challenge is that the agent gets added to the default solution by default, which can be inconvenient. You can manually include the plugin in your solution, but it's a bit of a hassle.

### Solutions and Workarounds
To address these challenges, I've found a few workarounds. For instance, when creating a prompt, it's essential to be specific with the instructions and ensure that the inputs are correctly configured. If the inputs are missing, you can manually add them by copying examples from other prompts.

Additionally, when deploying a test agent to a different environment, you need to manually add the plugins to the solution, as they aren't included by default. This can be done by adding existing custom operations as required by the deployment pipeline.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, while Co-pilot Studio tools are incredibly powerful, they come with their own set of challenges, especially when working with custom prompts. By being aware of these issues and using the workarounds mentioned, you can ensure a smoother experience. If you've encountered similar problems or have any solutions, I'd love to hear from you.
