# Preventing Agent Sprawl in Power Platform: A Simple Governance Hack

As organizations embrace the power of generative AI and agent-based automation, the ability for users to create agents in Microsoft’s Power Platform Copilot Studio is both a blessing and a challenge. While it empowers end users to innovate, it also opens the door to uncontrolled agent sprawl—where agents are created without oversight, potentially introducing risk and complexity.

In this post, I’ll walk through a quick and effective governance strategy to help manage agent publishing in the default environment, without stifling innovation.

## The Problem: Unrestricted Agent Creation

By default, any user can create agents in the Power Platform’s default environment. This is great for productivity, but it poses a governance risk. Agents are powerful tools—they can interact with data, trigger workflows, and even integrate with external systems. Without proper controls, this can lead to:

- **Data exposure risks**
- **Unintended automation**
- **Compliance issues**
- **Operational overhead**

## The Solution: Block Publishing in Default Environment

Here’s a simple governance hack: **disable publishing to any channel in the default environment**. This allows users to build and test agents freely, but prevents them from deploying those agents until they’ve met governance requirements.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Go to Power Platform Admin Center**  
   As a tenant administrator, navigate to the admin center.

2. **Create a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy**  
   - Go to **Data Policies**
   - Click **Create Policy**
   - Name it something like `Prevent Publishing Agents in Default`

3. **Configure the Policy**
   - Under **Connectors**, select all channels (e.g., Teams, Web, etc.)
   - Set them to **Blocked**
   - Ignore custom connectors if not relevant
   - Apply the policy to **multiple environments**, and specifically select the **default environment**

4. **Publish the Policy**
   - Once published, the policy takes effect immediately.
   - Any attempt to publish an agent in the default environment will trigger a clear error message.

## Real-World Impact

In a recent test, a user created an agent in the default environment. Upon trying to publish, they received an immediate error due to the new DLP policy. The message was clear: publishing is blocked due to a data loss prevention policy.

This approach allows users to experiment and learn without compromising governance. It’s especially useful for organizations that want to encourage responsible agent development.

---

## Best Practices

- **Communicate the Change**  
  Let users know about the publishing restriction so they don’t assume the platform is broken.

- **Enable Controlled Environments**  
  Provide managed environments for users who complete training or demonstrate responsible development practices.

- **Integrate with Change Management**  
  Make this part of a broader initiative to educate users on agent governance and responsible AI use.

## Final Thoughts

Agent sprawl is a real challenge—but with a simple DLP policy, you can strike a balance between innovation and control. This governance hack is quick to implement and highly effective. I’ll be sharing more documentation and examples soon to help organizations adopt similar practices.

Let’s keep building responsibly.
